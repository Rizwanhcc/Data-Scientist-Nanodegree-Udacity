# Data-Scientist-Nanodegree-Udacity
This repo contains the project completed for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.


### 1 Solving Data Science Problems
Learn the data science process, including how to build effective data visualizations, and how to communicate with various stakeholders.

#### PROJECT- Write a Data Science Blog Post
In this project, you will choose a dataset, identify three questions, and analyze the data to find answers to these questions. You will create a github repository with your project, and write a blog post to communicate your findings to the appropriate audience. The project will help you reinforce and extend your knowledge of machine learning, data visualization, and communication.

### 2 Software Engineering for Data Scientists
Develop software engineering skills that are essential for data scientists, such as creating unit tests and building classes.

### 3 Data Engineering for Data Scientists
Learn to work with data through the entire data science process, from running pipelines, transforming data, building models, and deploying solutions to the cloud.

#### PROJECT- Build Disaster Response Pipelines with Figure Eight
Figure Eight, a company focused on creating datasets for AI applications, has crowdsourced the tagging and translation of messages to improve disaster relief efforts. In this project, you’ll build a data pipeline to prepare message data from major natural disasters around the world. You’ll build a machine learning pipeline to categorize emergency messages based on the needs communicated by the sender.


### 4 Experiment Design and Recommendations
Learn to design experiments and analyze A/B test results. Explore approaches for building recommendation systems.

#### PROJECT- Design a Recommendation Engine with IBM
IBM has an online data science community where members can post tutorials, notebooks, articles, and datasets. In this project, you will build a recommendation engine, based on user behavior and social network in IBM Watson Studio's data platform, to surface content most likely to be relevant to a user.


### 5 Data Science Projects
Leverage what you’ve learned throughout the program to build your own open-ended Data Science project. This project will serve as a demonstration of your valuable abilities as a Data Scientist.

#### PROJECT- Data Science Capstone Project
You will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the program to build your own data science project. You will define the problem, identify and explore the data, perform your analyses, and present your solution in a blog post or frontend application. This project will serve as a demonstration of your ability as a Data Scientist, and will be an important piece of your job-ready portfolio.
